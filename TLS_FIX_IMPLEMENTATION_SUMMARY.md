# TLS Fix Implementation Summary

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Environment Variable Support
Added support for `AITI_DISABLE_SSL_HOOKS=1` environment variable to completely disable SSL hooks for testing.

### 2. Configuration File Support  
- Created `config/aiti_config.json` with support for per-process SSL hook skipping
- Added config file parsing in `InstallSslHooks()` that checks multiple paths:
  - Same directory as executable
  - `../config/aiti_config.json`
  - `../../config/aiti_config.json`

### 3. Stack Alignment Fixes
Added 16-byte stack alignment to all SSL/Schannel hook functions for Windows on ARM compatibility:
- `Mine_SSL_write()`
- `Mine_SSL_read()`
- `Mine_SSL_new()`
- `Mine_EncryptMessage()`
- `Mine_DecryptMessage()`
- `Mine_AcquireCredentialsHandleW()`

### 4. WinHTTP Context Preservation
Added context value preservation in `Mine_WinHttpSendRequest()` for WoA compatibility.

### 5. Build Support
- Created ARM64 build configuration: `build_arm64`
- Both x64 and ARM64 DLLs now build successfully

## Files Modified
- `dll/hooks.cpp` - Main hook implementation with all fixes
- `config/aiti_config.json` - Configuration file for skipping SSL hooks
- `TLS_TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive troubleshooting guide
- `TLS_FIX_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Environment Variable
```bash
set AITI_DISABLE_SSL_HOOKS=1
.\build_x64\injector\Release\ai_injector.exe "C:\Program Files\Microsoft VS Code\Code.exe"
```

### Test 2: Config File
Place `aiti_config.json` next to `ai_injector.exe` with Code.exe in skip list, then run normally.

### Test 3: ARM64 Build
```bash
.\build_arm64\injector\Release\ai_injector.exe "C:\Program Files\Microsoft VS Code\Code.exe"
```

## Build Commands
```bash
# x64 build
cmake --build build_x64 --config Release --target ai_hook

# ARM64 build  
cmake -B build_arm64 -A ARM64 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build_arm64 --config Release --target ai_hook
```

## Next Steps
1. Test with VS Code on Windows on ARM
2. Monitor logs in `%TEMP%\ai_hook_<PID>.log`
3. If issues persist, use Schannel ETW tracing for deeper debugging
