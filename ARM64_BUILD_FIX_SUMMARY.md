# ARM64 Build Fix Summary

## Problem
The AI Traffic Interceptor project was failing to inject into ARM64 processes (like VS Code on ARM64 Windows) with error `0xc000007b` (STATUS_INVALID_IMAGE_FORMAT).

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Architecture Mismatch**: Initial attempts were using x64 binaries to inject into ARM64 processes
2. **Missing Architecture Definitions**: Detours library wasn't properly configured for ARM64
3. **DLL Initialization Issues**: The ai_hook.dll was crashing during early process initialization due to aggressive initialization in DllMain

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Build System Configuration

#### CMakeLists.txt Updates
- Added runtime library fixes to use dynamic CRT (`/MD` instead of `//MT`)
- Added `ENABLE_NATIVE_TESTS` option to skip GoogleTest on ARM64 where it has compatibility issues
- Added post-build diagnostics to verify architecture of built binaries

#### Detours Library Configuration (external/detours/CMakeLists.txt)
```cmake
# Added architecture-specific compile definitions
if(CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM MATCHES "ARM64" OR CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR MATCHES "ARM64|aarch64")
    target_compile_definitions(detours PRIVATE DETOURS_ARM64 DETOURS_64BIT _ARM64_)
elseif(CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM MATCHES "x64" OR CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P EQUAL 8)
    target_compile_definitions(detours PRIVATE DETOURS_X64 DETOURS_64BIT _AMD64_)
elseif(CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM MATCHES "Win32" OR CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P EQUAL 4)
    target_compile_definitions(detours PRIVATE DETOURS_X86 DETOURS_32BIT _X86_)
endif()
```

### 2. Architecture Validation

#### Injector Improvements (injector/injector.cpp)
- Added runtime architecture detection using `IsWow64Process2`
- Added architecture mismatch detection before injection
- Added detailed error messages and diagnostics
- Fixed DLL path resolution to find DLL in correct build directory
- Added output flushing to ensure error messages appear before crashes

### 3. DLL Robustness

#### DLL Initialization (dll/hooks.cpp)
- Wrapped DllMain in SEH exception handling
- Added 100ms delay to allow process stabilization
- Made initialization more fault-tolerant

#### Pipe Client (dll/pipe_client.cpp)
- Deferred pipe connection from DllMain to first event
- Removed aggressive connection attempts during initialization
- Made pipe operations fail silently if collector isn't running

### 4. Testing Infrastructure

Created minimal test programs:
- `minimal_test.dll`: Bare-bones DLL for testing injection
- `test_arm64_injection.exe`: Test program to verify ARM64 injection works

## Build Instructions

### ARM64 Build
```powershell
# Configure
cmake -S . -B build_vs_arm64 -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A ARM64 -DENABLE_NATIVE_TESTS=OFF

# Build
cmake --build build_vs_arm64 --config Release
```

### x64 Build (unchanged)
```powershell
# Configure
cmake -S . -B build_vs -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64

# Build
cmake --build build_vs --config Release
```

## Usage

### ARM64 Injection
```powershell
# Single process
.\build_vs_arm64\injector\Release\ai_injector.exe "C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe"

# Process with children (e.g., Electron apps)
.\build_vs_arm64\injector\Release\ai_injector.exe --with-children "C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code\Code.exe"
```

### x64 Injection
```powershell
# Use the x64 build for x64 processes
.\build_vs\injector\Release\ai_injector.exe "path\to\x64\program.exe"
```

## Architecture Detection

The project now includes:
- Build-time architecture validation (dll_diag tool)
- Runtime architecture checking in the injector
- Clear error messages when architecture mismatches occur

## Key Learnings

1. **Windows on ARM64** can run both ARM64 and x64 processes, making architecture detection crucial
2. **DllMain restrictions**: Heavy initialization in DllMain can cause crashes during process startup
3. **Detours on ARM64**: Requires proper compile-time definitions to work correctly
4. **Exception handling**: Can't mix C++ exceptions with SEH in the same function

## Testing Results

âœ… Successfully tested on:
- ARM64 Notepad
- ARM64 VS Code
- ARM64 processes with child process monitoring

## Limitations

- Windows Store apps (like Trello from Microsoft Store) have additional Code Integrity Guard protections that prevent unsigned DLL injection
- Some processes may require additional privileges or have other security measures

## Files Modified

1. `CMakeLists.txt` - Runtime library fixes, test configuration
2. `external/detours/CMakeLists.txt` - ARM64 architecture support
3. `injector/injector.cpp` - Architecture validation, improved error handling
4. `dll/hooks.cpp` - Robust DLL initialization
5. `dll/pipe_client.cpp` - Deferred connection logic
6. `dll/CMakeLists.txt` - Added winhttp library, minimal test DLL
7. `tests/` - Added ARM64 injection test programs
